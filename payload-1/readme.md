# Payload-1

I'm calling it payload-1 because I do not know what to name this malware.

Found this while digging through some darkweb stuff, the spammer claimed it was an 
osint tool so I decided to dig through this one myself back sometime in late 2022
turns out it was skid-malware and everything was base64/gzip encrypted making it 
extremely easy to come in with Decompyle++ and pretty much destory these skiddie's 
dreams of ripping off other users after almost an entire year of holding onto it 
I decided to go ahead and dump it. Please note that I have the code decrypted from it's
original state because looking at a pile of garbage would be very boring to the average 
user.

# WARNING!
THIS CODE MAY STILL WORK, DO NOT RUN IT!
